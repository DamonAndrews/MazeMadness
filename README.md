As a user, I would like to login to play an interactive game

When I load the login page
Then I am presented with the game's title, and options to login or create a username

When I click the create username button,
Then I am prompted to enter my email address, desired username, and my password, and I am brought back to the login page

When I click the log in button,
Then I see instructions displayed, along with options to start game or view leaderboard

When I click on the view leaderboard button, 
Then I see the top 5 all-time high scores by username

When I click start the game button, 
Then the game initializes

When I click the Quit game button,
Then I am directed to the Game Over page

When game ends,
Then I am presented with Game Over screen

When viewing the Game Over screen,
Then I see my most recent score, and have options to see Leaderboard or Start Game again
